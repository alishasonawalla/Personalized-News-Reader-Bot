**How it works?**

NewsBerry accesses the NewsAPI and gathers data from multiple news sources. It pipelines that data through the IBM Watson API in order to get cool features about the news and stores the data in a database. When a user asks NewsBerry a question, it queries the database and responds to the user with requested news articles.

**Cool Features**

Are you curious about who the most written-about person is right now? (I think you can get that one right) Do you wish to know more about the entities such as person, location, and companies you care about? NewsBerry automatically sorts the data from the sources, ranks, and then displays the result in visually appealing charts.

With the help of IBM Natural Language Understanding, NewsBerry is able to read the tone of the articles the world is reading. With a quick function, it displays the sentiments according to IBM NLU of all the recent news.
